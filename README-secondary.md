## Divine Right of Capital



### **1. Feudal Roots of Capitalism** 

####**Parallels**:

- **Shareholders:** Like feudal elites, shareholders extract wealth without labor, perpetuating a system where 99% of stock market activity is speculative trading, disconnected from value creation.

- **Managers:** While shareholders dominate, CEOs also extract value through inflated stock options and cost-cutting.  

####**Legal Frameworks**:

- **Property vs. Community:** Corporations are treated as property (not as human communities), enabling ownership by absentee shareholders. Legal precedents like *Dodge v Ford* entrench shareholder primacy.

- **Corporate Personhood:** The *Santa Clara* court decision granted corporations constitutional rights, enabling political influence and shielding them from democratic accountability.  

####**Costs to People & Environment**:

- **Employees as Serfs:** Excluded from balance sheets, workers are labeled as “expenses” despite driving value creation, with their productivity outstripping their pay three times over.
- **Externalized Harms:** Corporate practices conceal environmental degradation and community abandonment (e.g., factory shutdowns) in financial ledgers.

### **2. Aristocracy vs. Democracy**  

####**Feudal Principles**:

1. **Worldview:** Maximize shareholder returns; minimize worker pay.  
2. **Privilege:** Shareholders claim wealth without labor.  
3. **Property:** Corporations as owned objects, not communities.  
4. **Governance:** Voting restricted to shareholders.  
5. **Liberty:** Pre-democratic liberty for property holders.  
6. **Sovereignty:** Corporate self-rule, evading public accountability.  

####**Democratic Reforms**:

1. **Enlightenment:** Equal economic rights for all stakeholders.  
2. **Equality:** Ensure wealth flows to those who create value – labor and communities alike.  
3. **Public Good:** Corporations as semipublic entities serving society.  
4. **Democracy:** Employee governance (e.g., Works Councils).  
5. **Justice:** End corporate personhood; equal legal standing.  
6. **Evolution:** Gradual systemic reform over revolution.  

### **3. Solutions**

####**Structural Changes**:

• **Employee Ownership**: Companies like SAIC (90% employee-owned) tie rewards to contribution.  
• **Financial Redesign**:  
   - Employee Income Statements: Quantify labor’s value.  
   - Community Impact Reports: Track environmental and social costs.  

####**Policy Changes**:

• **Stakeholder Statutes**: 32 U.S. states already allow boards to consider non-shareholder interests.  
• **Tax Reforms**: Incentivize broad-based ownership; penalize externalities.  
• **Inheritance Laws**: Address generational wealth concentration.  

####**Agents of Change**:

• **Investors**: Put money into socially and environmentally responsible funds and follow SEC rules on transparency  
• **Business Students**: Challenge MBA curricula’s shareholder-centric models.  
• **Employees**: Advocate for board representation and wage transparency.  

### **4. Moving Forward**

####**Practical Steps**:

• **Capital Democracy**: Align wealth accumulation with productivity *and* environmental stewardship.  
• **Knowledge Economy**: Recognize employees as creators of intangible assets (e.g., innovation).  

####**Cultural Shifts**:

• Reframe speculation as being "investment", challenging shareholder legitimacy.  
• Replace “shareholder primacy” with stakeholder solidarity.  

### **Conclusion**

Kelly’s book advocates a system where prosperity is shared, sustainable, and democratically governed. By dismantling aristocratic legal frameworks, empowering labor, and redefining corporate purpose, capitalism can evolve into a tool for collective well-being.
